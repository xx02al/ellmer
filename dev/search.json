The article details what a robust third-party testing regime should include: trusted tests, credible assessors, and a balance between safety assurance and regulatory burden. It advocates for multi-actor involvement (companies, universities, governments), iterative prototyping, and funding for governmental infrastructure to drive effective regulation while avoiding overly burdensome procedures that stifle innovation or entrench large incumbents. The article emphasizes the need to balance openness in AI research, the necessity for safety-related limits on open dissemination of powerful models, and the risks of regulatory capture.
