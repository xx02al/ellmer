      ellmer provides a simple interface to a wide range of LLM providers. Use
      the `chat_` functions to initialize a `Chat` object for a specific
      provider and model. Once created, use the methods of the `Chat` object
      to send messages, receive responses, manage tools and extract structured
      data.

    desc: >
      These classes abstract away behaviour differences in chat providers so
      that for typical ellmer use you don't need to worry about them. You'll need
      to learn more about the objects if you're doing something that's only
      supported by one provider, or if you're implementing a new provider.
