        Three Jokes About Statisticians\n\n**1. The Drowning Statistician**\nA statistician
        is someone who could drown crossing a river that''s an average of three feet
        deep.\n\n**2. The Uncertain Response**\nThree statisticians go hunting. They
        spot a deer. The first statistician shoots and misses—two feet to the left.
        The second shoots and misses—two feet to the right. The third statistician
        jumps up and down shouting, \"We got it! We got it!\"\n\n**3. The Kidnapped
        Statistician**\nA kidnapper grabs a statistician and threatens, \"Give me
        all your money or you''re average!\" The statistician replies, \"I think you
        mean ''or you''re history.''\" The kidnapper responds, \"Don''t tell me my
        job—you tell me the mean!\"\n\n---\n\n*These jokes play on statistical concepts
        like averages, means, and the classic distinction between theoretical data
        and practical reality!*"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":215,"service_tier":"standard"}}'
