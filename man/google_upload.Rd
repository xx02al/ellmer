\usage{
google_upload(

  base_url = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/",

  mime_type = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to a file to upload.}

\item{base_url}{The base URL to the endpoint; the default uses OpenAI.}

\item{api_key}{API key to use for authentication.

You generally should not supply this directly, but instead set the \code{GOOGLE_API_KEY} environment variable.
The best place to set this is in \code{.Renviron},
which you can easily edit by calling \code{usethis::edit_r_environ()}.
For Gemini, you can alternatively set \code{GEMINI_API_KEY}.}

\item{mime_type}{Optionally, specify the mime type of the file.
If not specified, will be guesses from the file extension.}
}
\value{
A \verb{<ContentUploaded>} object that can be passed to \verb{$chat()}.

This function uploads a file then waits for Gemini to finish processing it
so that you can immediately use it in a prompt. It's experimental because
it's currently Gemini specific, and we expect other providers to evolve
similar feature in the future.

Uploaded files are automatically deleted after 2 days. Each file must be
less than 2 GB and you can upload a total of 20 GB. ellmer doesn't currently
provide a way to delete files early; please
\href{https://github.com/tidyverse/ellmer/issues}{file an issue} if this would
be useful for you.
