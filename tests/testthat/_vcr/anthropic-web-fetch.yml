        Lucas\nTurmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes
        to outlying star systems is in dispute.\nHoping to resolve the matter with
        a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped
        all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.\nWhile the Congress of the Republic
        endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has
        secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in
        the galaxy, to settle the conflict….\nAttack of the Clones\nReleased: 2002-05-16\nDirector:
        George Lucas\nThere is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar
        systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic.\nThis separatist
        movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made it
        difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order
        in the galaxy.\nSenator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to
        the Galactic Senate to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE
        REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi….\nRevenge of the Sith\nReleased:
        2005-05-19\nDirector: George Lucas\nWar! The Republic is crumbling under attacks
        by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil
        is everywhere.\nIn a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous,
        has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader
        of the Galactic Senate.\nAs the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the
        besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate
        mission to rescue the captive Chancellor….\nA New Hope\nReleased: 1977-05-25\nDirector:
        George Lucas\nIt is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from
        a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.\nDuring
        the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire’s ultimate
        weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy
        an entire planet.\nPursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Leia
        races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save
        her people and restore freedom to the galaxy….\nThe Empire Strikes Back\nReleased:
        1980-05-17\nDirector: Irvin Kershner\nIt is a dark time for the Rebellion.
        Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the
        Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy.\nEvading
        the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker
        has established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth.\nThe evil
        lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched thousands
        of remote probes into the far reaches of space….\nReturn of the Jedi\nReleased:
        1983-05-25\nDirector: Richard Marquand\nLuke Skywalker has returned to his
        home planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the
        clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.\nLittle does Luke know that
        the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space
        station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star.\nWhen completed,
        this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of rebels
        struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy…\nThe Force Awakens\nReleased:
        2015-12-11\nDirector: J. J. Abrams\nLuke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
